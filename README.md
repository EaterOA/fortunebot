# What #

An IRC bot written for the UCLA Linux User Group, #lug@irc.gimp.net. 

Accepts these commands:
- !insult - Insults you elegantly
- !fortune - Outputs a short UNIX fortune cookie
- !8ball - Gives a magic 8-ball response
- !weather - Provides weather information about a specified zipcode

Very useful stuff, especially the insult.

# Dependencies #

The bot uses Python irclib. Find that at http://python-irclib.sourceforge.net/

The init script is designed for SysV systems such as Debian.
